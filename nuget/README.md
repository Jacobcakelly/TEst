Sample Package Projects: Nuget
==============================

The Nuget Sample Package Project will contain three samples for developing with
Nuget and the JFrog Platform.  The first will contain a small library that is
built and pushed to a JFrog Platform Nuget type artifact repository.  The second
will build upon the first by using the library, along with public packages from
a JFrog Platform Nuget type remote repository, to create a simple web
application.  The third project will bring in a number of other features of the
JFrog Platform.
